# carla_maps
 This is a git-lfs repository for storing maps and map data for the CARLA open source vehicle simulator. 
See [CARLA docs](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or the [thillRobot docs](https://github.com/thillRobot/carla_simulator/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

This is in rough shape right now, but I have been working on maps recently. I am going to update this repo soon with some useful examples of the map making process.

While testing I realized that `Git lfs` requires a paid data plan after 1GB. I already own plenty of local and cloud space. I think I will move the large files out of here are just keep the configs and small stuff. So, is there any reason for this to be a separate package? Hmm...
